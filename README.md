# github-zach-bot: The Crow Father

The Crow Father is an AI-powered chatbot designed to respond intelligently (and sometimes sarcastically) to messages in your fantasy football chat. Itâ€™s built to integrate with real-time data from the Sleeper API and eventually leverage ChatGPT for contextual banter, trash talk, or useful roster insights.

## TODO

- [ ] Integrate the [Sleeper API](https://docs.sleeper.app/) to fetch:
  - Team names
  - Rosters
  - Usernames
  - Matchups
- [ ] Add support for ChatGPT-style conversations (via OpenAI API)
- [ ] Auto-roast last place team (optional, but highly encouraged)

npm run start
